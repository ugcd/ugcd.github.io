abstract = {Altered mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels have been associated with common diseases in humans. We investigated the genetic mechanism that controls mtDNA levels using genome-wide linkage analyses in families from the Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia Project (GAIT). We measure mtDNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR in 386 subjects from 21 extended Spanish families. A variance component linkage method using 485 microsatellites was conducted to evaluate linkage and to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the control of mtDNA levels. The heritalibility of mtDNA levels was 0.33 (p=1.82e-05). We identified a QTL on Chromosome 2 (LOD=2.21) using all of the subjects, independently on their sex. When females and males were analysed separately, three QTLs were identified. Females showed the same QTL on Chromosome 2 (LOD=3.09), indicating that the QTL identified in the analysis using all of the subjects was a strong female QTL, and another one on Chromosome 3 (LOD=2.67), whereas in males a QTL was identified on Chromosome 1 (LOD=2.81). These QTLs were fine-mapped to find associations with mtDNA levels. The most significant SNP association was for the rs10888838 on Chromosome 1 in males. This SNP mapped to the gene MRPL37, involved in mitochondrial protein translation. The rs2140855 on Chromosome 2 showed association in the analysis using all of the subjects. It was near the gene CMPK2, which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme of the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Our results provide evidence of a sex-specific genetic mechanism for the control of mtDNA levels and provide a framework to identify new genes that influence mtDNA levels.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prostanoids play a critical role in clinical areas such as inflammation, thrombosis, immune response, and cancer. Although some studies suggest that there are genes that determine variability of some prostanoid-related phenotypes, the genetic influence on these traits has not been evaluated.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences to the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway-related phenotypes, cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, microsomal-PGE-synthase-1 and TxA-synthase expression, and thromboxane-A(2) and prostaglandin-E(2) production by stimulated whole blood, were assessed in a sample of 308 individuals in 15 extended families. The effects of measured covariates (such as sex, age, and smoking), genes, and environmental variables shared by members of a household were quantified. Heritabilities ranging from 0.406 to 0.634 for enzyme expression and from 0.283 to 0. 751 for prostanoid production were found.

CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate clearly the importance of genetic factors in determining variation in phenotypes that are components of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathways. The presence of such strong genetic effects suggest that it will be possible to localize previously unknown genes that influence quantitative variation in these phenotypes, some of which affect multiple aspects of cell biology, with important clinical implications.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood is a common technique in diagnostic laboratories. Abnormal values have been identified in prevalent infections, autoimmune disorders and neoplastic diseases. Reference ranges for lymphocyte subsets of a healthy population from Spain are scarce. METHODS: The study was performed on 319 healthy subjects, aged 4-88 years, from 709 individuals enrolled in the GAIT-2 Project (Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia). Health status, age, sex, fertility, BMI and lifestyle (physical activity, cigarette smoking and ethanol intake) were assessed using standardized criteria. The percentage of lymphocyte subsets was determined using flow cytometry (Lymphogramâ„¢). Percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD3-CD56+, CD3+CD4-CD8- double-negative (DN) T cells, CD3+CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were recorded for each case. RESULTS: Children had a significantly higher percentage of CD19+ and DN cells than adults. Women had a significantly higher percentage of CD3+ and CD4+ and a lower percentage of natural killer cells than men. Increases in BMI were inversely associated with the percentage of DN cells. Physical activity increased the percentage of lymphocytes and DN cells. Alcohol consumers had a lower percentage of CD19+ and DN cells, and a higher percentage of CD4+. CONCLUSION: This study provides reference ranges for lymphocyte subsets of healthy children and adults in a Mediterranean population (Spain) and determines the influence of lifestyle factors on these values.},
